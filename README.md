# What Is Code Testing
I was too intimated by the concept of code testing. Why
will you test your code in the first place? Do
you not trust your own code? Will it
not work as intended?

But then by reading so much about this, I grasped
the idea already.

Without code testing, the tendency is to test
your code by running the entire program and
manually testing it. So, you are testing
it still without knowing it.

For students doing programming in Robotics,
since their focus is just to know
whether their code is actually working,
they will be manually running the code
from time to time. If the code did not
work as intended, then they will trace
the problem. This entire process
is being repeated and is actually time
consuming particularly when the code
is getting longer and longer. And take
note, it is not yet one big project.
But testing is already there, they are 
doing that manually.

## Why Code Testing
As was mentioned from my example,
if you don't have any idea about
code testing, well you are doing it
without knowing it. The tendency is to
run the whole program and manually 
test whether all the parts of the 
code is working as intended.

Now, this is only practical if your
project is just too small. But
software development nowadays 
is already a very sophisticated one.
So, testing that manually will surely
be a headache. Plus, testing it
manually is not that efficient.
And even a well-tested code will not
always work as intended to be.
Our role is just to minimize and 
maintain the code.
